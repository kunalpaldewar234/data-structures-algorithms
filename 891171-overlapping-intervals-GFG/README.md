# [Overlapping Intervals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/overlapping-intervals--174556/1)
## Easy
You are given a 2D array arr[][] which represents a set of intervals, where each element arr[i] = [start, end] defines an interval. Your task is to determine if any two intervals in the given set overlap.
Note: Two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] overlap if they have at least one common value, i.e., a ≤ d and c ≤ b.
Examples:
Input: n = 4, arr[][] = [[1, 3], [5, 7], [2, 4], [6, 8]]
Output: true
Explanation: The intervals [1, 3] and [2, 4] overlap.
Input: n = 4, arr[][] = [[1, 3], [7, 9], [4, 6], [10, 13]]
Output: false
Explanation: No pair of intervals overlap.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr[i][0] &lt; arr[i][1]&nbsp;≤ 105&nbsp;&nbsp;2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
